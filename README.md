I made a point to keep all my failures in this project because I wanted to
1. Be able to look back and compare my old implementation methods and compare them to my current ones to see my improvement
2. To use this project as a sort of sandbox in the future
(However, I realize that is difficult to grade so I am going to re-organize it to be a little easier once I get the chance)
